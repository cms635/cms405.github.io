We have so internalized the modern conception of self that we now consider it an axiom that the individual experience is inherently subjective and unique. For that reason, the selfie assumes vast implications through its ability to reproduce instantaneous images of ourselves in any physical context. In some ways, this ability exacerbates the individualist tendencies of the western mindset. However, despite the criticisms which can be made of the inherent egocentricism which plagues personal technology bubbles, the ability to express the complex inner workings of individuals through self portraits remains deeply consequential in developing raw, human connections not only in our personal relationships, but more broadly in humanity's shared artistic vocabulary. There is no wonder then why the most well-liked images on social media are often self portraits.
