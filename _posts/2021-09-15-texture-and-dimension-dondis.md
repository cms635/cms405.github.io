### Texture
Unlike the other elements, texture is the visual element that often suggests the qualities of touch, another sense. Texture can be appreciated by either sight or touch or both together, but the visual and tactile elements, while similar in meaning, differ in value. This element can be emulated through small changes in a material's surface, but modern societal norms have choked the usage of our tactile sense, causing most people to understand that art must be seen, not touched, like the expensive paintings in an art gallery. Thus, texture has generally been reduced to the illusion, the implication of touch, as shown below. We cannot touch this image, but we can make assumptions about how it would feel beneath our fingers.

### Dimension
Similar to texture, dimension relies on illusion to suggest three-dimensions on a two-dimensional image. To suggest dimension, artists rely on effective use of perspective, particularly with vanishing points, to imply that objects and parts of the objects depicted in an artwork are farther away. In works of art that are three-dimensional, such as architecture and sculpture, artists must be able to visualize, plan and construct their artwork in full dimension. This often involves thinking of the final work in various views, such as how it would look from the top, side, or bottom. Below is a photograph depicting use of perspective to imply dimension.
