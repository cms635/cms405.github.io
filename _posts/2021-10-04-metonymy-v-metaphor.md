	This reading examines three similar but differing relationships. Metonymy: one thing standing for another concept, Metaphor: understanding one concept in terms of another, Blending: mapping two concepts into a different concept where one doesn’t stand for another. Out of these three techniques, metaphor stands out as the easiest to grasp. In our daily lives, we tend to use metaphors to describe processes to others as a form of easing a communication bridge. Metonymy appears different in the way that it is more literal; something concrete standing in for another. This Coke and Pepsi example conveys the brand’s messaging using a kind of Metonymy. Clearly, the Pepsi is trick-or-treating dressed as something “spooky” (i.e. a worse beverage). Although this example is literally something standing in for another item, the Pepsi is also like one of us dressing up for Halloween. We understand Pepsi’s humor in terms of an action we take on Halloween. Another Coke example conveys more of a metaphor. In this image, two people’s hands come together to form a Coke bottle. The original ad ran the messaging that CocaCola is for anyone and everyone. This metaphor reveals two different individuals coming together (allusion to hand-holding relationship) in the spirit of Coke.
