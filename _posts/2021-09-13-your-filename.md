**The Line** 

The line is one step above in elemental complexity from the dot, imbuing it with more suggestive capability in visual design. Although often conceived in terms of its more linear qualities when used in technical disciplines, the line's usage is not bound by clearly defined rules. It is a creative tool which may be employed for juxtaposition, texture, movement, etc., clearly conveying information by stripping design to its most skeletal meaning. The sketches of William Steig, oftentimes almost grotesque in nature, demonstrate the capacity of the line in conjuring the mood of a fantasy scene as well as defining character personalities (as seen in many of Steig's picture book drawing -- most famously, Shrek). In the picture below, a group of clowns dance merrily to the music of a chicken and dog. The drawing seems a bit crude at first glance. However, its beauty lies not in a demonstration of technical acumen but in the creation of distinct personalities for each character from each facetious linestroke.

**Color**
As Dondis states in the piece, color is the element which appeals most to our emotions. There is a reason why we are asked when we are young "What's your favorite color?". Color is inextricably tied to how we perceive of ourselves and our surroundings, having cemented itself in cultural iconography as a representation of shared experience. Fauvism was a 20th century artistic movement which emphasized the use of often bold and highly saturated colors in impressionistic drawings to evoke a strong emotional response from the audience. The example below is one of the most famous works by Henri Matisse, Woman with a Hat. Rarely in the painting does Matisse employ colors which would naturally occur in physical reality, instead choosing to accentuate the somberness of the woman's expression with hues of blue and green.
