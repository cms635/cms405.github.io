From looking through the Gestalt website, it was interesting to think about the different visual habits that we have. Oftentimes, humans naturally perceive things a certain way and it was fascinating to see how Gestalt psychology's 6 laws explained it. I think that this is also extremely important to keep in mind as we create designs since people will view designs with their built-in view/natural tendencies.

One of the points I found interesting in the Harrell reading was his point on how signs lack meaning without context. Harrell brought up about how different contexts and different individuals can create different interpretations of the symbol. The way humans associate a sign with a specific meaning is interesting. We use signs to convey something in a more visual setting, but the meaning is actually conferred upon by our pre-existing notions or how we relate the visual with the meaning.
