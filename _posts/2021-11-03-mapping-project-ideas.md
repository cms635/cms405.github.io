I was interested in techniques of mapping the unseen, like the pollution map in Tutfe's text. I was drawn to Paula Scher's maximalist technique of making the unseen seen, tangibly part of the geography of her represented worlds. Here she adds people to a world map and area and time codes to the map of the US. She describes her maps of exercises of power, as there are no prepackaged facts but only representations of incomplete information. 

I would be interested in taking some institutional aspect of space--or some other visually intangible element, like scent or sound--and baking them over the physical-space presentation of a map.
